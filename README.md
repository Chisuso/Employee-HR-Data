## Case #1: Employee Satisfaction Analysis

**Code File:** [employee_satisfaction_analysis.py](https://github.com/Chisuso/Employee-HR-Data/blob/main/employee_satisfaction_analysis.py)

**Description:** In this case, we'll dive deep into employee satisfaction. We'll explore satisfaction rates, departmental variations, and even examine gender-based differences. Get ready for captivating plots and charts that unveil what keeps our employees smiling! üòä

## Case #2: Employee Productivity Analysis

**Code File:** [employee_productivity_analysis.py](https://github.com/Chisuso/Employee-HR-Data/blob/main/employee_tenure_analysis.py)

**Description:** Ever wondered what makes a productive employee? Case #2 answers that question! We'll analyze projects completed, productivity scores, and feedback scores. Through histograms and statistics, we'll discover the secrets to a high-performing workforce. üöÄ

## Case #3: Employee Tenure Analysis

**Code File:** [employee_tenure_analysis.py](https://github.com/Chisuso/Employee-HR-Data/blob/main/%20employee_productivity_analysis.py)

**Description:** Tenure isn't just about counting the years; it's about understanding our employees' journeys. In this case, we'll calculate tenure in years, examine departmental variations, and even conduct a t-test to see if there's a significant difference between departments. The histograms will tell tales of dedication and loyalty. üï∞Ô∏è
